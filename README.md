## Overview

While Windows users have the luxury of SteamPipeGUI for deploying builds effortlessly, macOS users face the challenge of using Steam commands in their Command Line Interface (CLI). Steam's documentation can be unclear for first-timers. To address this, I created this repository, providing a tool to publish new builds on Steam directly from your Unity Editor on macOS. The best part? It reduces the publishing time from 30 minutes to under 1 minute.

## Getting Started with Steamworks

Follow these steps to set up your game on Steam:

1. **Create a Steamworks Account:**
   Visit the Steamworks website and follow the registration process to set up your developer account.

2. **Access the Steamworks Dashboard:**
   Log in and navigate to the Steamworks dashboard.

3. **Create Your Application:**
   Initiate the process of creating a new application for your game within the Steamworks dashboard.

4. **Obtain Your App ID:**
   Steam will assign a unique App ID to your game during the application creation process.

## Download Steam SDK

The Steamworks SDK provides a range of features which are designed to help ship your application or game on Steam in an efficient manner.

You can download the latest version of the Steamworks SDK [here.](https://partner.steamgames.com/?goto=%2Fdownloads%2Flist)

Inside Steam SDK is where your builds are located. Also, there are some .vdf scripts located inside the SDK folder, and they are tricky to set up. But do not worry, because this tool will handle all of it for you. You only need to provide an APP ID and DEPOT ID, which you can learn about in further steps.

## Configuring Launch Options

To configure launch options:

1. Go to Steamworks Dashboard.
2. Click on Dashboard and select your app.
3. Go to **Edit Steamworks Settings** > Installation > General Installation.
4. Add your Launch Options for each platform.

   Example:

## Installing Depots

Depots organize game content into categories. Follow these steps to create depots for each platform:

1. Go to the [Steamworks dashboard](https://partner.steamgames.com/).
2. Select your app and navigate to the "Edit Steamworks Settings" section.
3. In the left menu, choose "SteamPipe" and then select "Depots."
4. Click on "Add new Depot" to create a new depot.

5. Fill in the necessary details for your depot, such as the name and description.
6. Configure the content for the depot, specifying the files and folders associated with this particular depot.
7. Save your changes.

Repeat these steps for each platform you intend to support. Depots allow you to organize and manage different aspects of your game content efficiently on the Steam platform.
